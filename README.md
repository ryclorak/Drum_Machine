Following a tutorial from freecodecamp (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3J3PZj0zi0) for a drum machine with pygame!

This is why I subscribe to the newsletter, I'm excited to use it myself!
I've also never used pygame so that's cool too.

I'm making some adjustments as I go along, partly OCD-driven (rearranging instruments to make more sense to me, based on the sounds), partly stylistically driven (I'll probably end up rewriting some of this to be cleaner), but partly also just to make the code prettier.

I'm including some comments so I can hopefully understand what's going on, especially with pygame functions and magic numbers contained within

Now that the tutorial is done (I can change the bpm/number of beats by 5 and 1 respectively, turn on and off different sounds, click and clear the board, save/load beats), I'm adding some features. So here's my first changelog:

6/4: added ability to greatly increase/decrease BPM and number of beats, adding 4 new buttons and moving the buttons around to accommodate. Apparently re-adding removed beats re-adds whatever sounds were selected, saving whatever progress was made!

6/4: added ability to reset bpm to 240 and beats to 8
